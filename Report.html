that learn from their environment. In recent years, researchers have explored the connections between these two seemingly distinct fields, and have found compelling evidence that they are more closely related than previously thought. This paper examines these connections and their implications, highlighting the potential for reinforcement learning principles to enhance our understanding of evolution and the role of feedback in evolutionary systems.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c31" id="h.6bvwbajtcu8h"><span class="c16 c5 c8">Introduction</span></h1><h2 class="c12 c17" id="h.yjdylmu1aeeh"><span class="c14 c8"></span></h2><p class="c2 c21 subtitle" id="h.24sd26tm2q4o"><span class="c1">Evolutionary theory has been a cornerstone of biology for over a century, explaining how species adapt and change over time. At the same time, reinforcement learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, allowing machines to learn from their environment and improve their performance over time. Despite their seemingly disparate fields, recent research has revealed surprising connections between evolution and reinforcement learning. This paper explores these connections in depth, examining how reinforcement learning can inform our understanding of evolutionary processes, the role of feedback in driving evolutionary change, and the potential implications for our understanding of the natural world. We also explore the philosophical implications of these connections, including the simulation theory in physics and the possibility that nature itself could be a simulation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c31" id="h.17dp8vu"><span class="c5 c8 c16">1.Evolution as Reinforcement Learning: A New Perspective on Biological Change</span></h1><h2 class="c12" id="h.3rdcrjn"><span>1.1 Evolution as a complex learning system</span></h2><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.fchyd5o043j1"><span>Evolution is a complex and dynamic process that involves a wide range of biological and environmental factors. Traditionally, evolution has been understood as a process of natural selection, in which organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and repro</span><span class="c1">duce. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence have led some researchers to explore the potential connections between evolution and reinforcement learning, a form of machine learning that is based on a system of rewards and punishments.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.f4mb33ay0ved"><span class="c1">Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves training an agent to take actions that lead to desirable outcomes, while avoiding actions that lead to negative outcomes. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments, and uses this feedback to adjust its behavior over time. This process is similar in many ways to natural selection, in which organisms that exhibit behaviors that lead to positive outcomes are more likely to survive and pass on their genes to the next generation.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.xspzvl444f6k"><span class="c1">Several studies have explored the potential connections between reinforcement learning and biological systems. For example, a recent study used a reinforcement learning algorithm to simulate the evolution of a population of digital organisms, and found that the resulting organisms exhibited similar patterns of behavior to those seen in real biological systems (Watson et al., 2019). Another study used a reinforcement learning algorithm to model the evolution of social behavior in birds, and found that the algorithm was able to accurately predict the behaviors of real birds (Podos et al., 2018).</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.pnyanbpkkpq"><span class="c1">These studies suggest that the principles of reinforcement learning may be applicable to understanding the complexity and adaptability of biological systems. By viewing evolution as a form of reinforcement learning, we can gain new insights into the processes that shape the natural world. This perspective can also provide new opportunities for enhancing our understanding of artificial intelligence, by using biological systems as a source of inspiration for developing more efficient and adaptable learning algorithms.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.ao9k3cs59qcr"><span class="c14 c8">1.2 Similarities and differences between reinforcement learning and natural selection</span></h2><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.qntj9oaxcidz"><span class="c1">While there are clear similarities between reinforcement learning and natural selection, there are also important differences that must be considered. One key difference is that reinforcement learning typically involves a single agent that receives feedback based on its individual actions, while natural selection operates at the level of the population, with certain traits becoming more or less common over time based on their impact on the survival and reproduction of individuals.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.x5s1u8skdanx"><span class="c1">Another difference is that reinforcement learning involves explicit feedback in the form of rewards or punishments, while natural selection operates through a more implicit process of differential reproductive success. Additionally, reinforcement learning is often focused on optimizing a single objective function, while natural selection operates within a complex and dynamic environment with multiple objectives and constraints.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.9o002e7j6ui4"><span class="c1">Despite these differences, there are also clear similarities between reinforcement learning and natural selection. Both processes involve the acquisition and use of information to improve fitness and survival, and both are based on a system of rewards and punishments that drive the evolution of adaptive traits. By considering these similarities and differences, we can gain new insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive biological change and adaptation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.edtebzmeacy8"><span class="c14 c8">1.3 Implications of a reinforcement learning perspective for our understanding of evolution</span></h2><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.y0rfvnx19urc"><span class="c1">Adopting a reinforcement learning perspective on evolution has several implications for our understanding of how biological change occurs. One key implication is that it highlights the importance of feedback and learning in driving adaptation and change. Instead of viewing evolution as a blind and random process, a reinforcement learning perspective emphasizes the role of feedback and the use of past experiences to inform future behavior and adaptation.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.zbp42c80036f"><span class="c1">Furthermore, this perspective underscores the importance of variability and diversity in promoting adaptive change. Just as reinforcement learning agents must explore a range of actions to discover new solutions, biological populations must maintain a diverse range of traits and strategies to ensure the continued evolution of adaptive traits.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.j77ce4qb8zsh"><span class="c1">Finally, a reinforcement learning perspective also suggests new approaches to studying and modeling evolutionary processes. By applying concepts and techniques from reinforcement learning to the study of evolution, we can gain new insights into the mechanisms underlying biological change and develop more accurate and predictive models of how evolution operates.</span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.p3myu7m8llwz"><span class="c16 c5 c8"></span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c31" id="h.dwkryt2e7xtb"><span>2.

In reinforcement learning, an agent receives rewards for actions that lead to positive outcomes (i.e., achieving goals or avoiding negative consequences) and updates its behavior accordingly to maximize future rewards. Similarly, in evolution, organisms that possess traits that increase their probability of survival and reproduction are more likely to pass those traits on to future generations, ultimately resulting in the evolution of adaptations that enhance survival and reproductive success.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.n1xzt2ipjlv7"><span class="c1">The importance of survival in shaping the course of evolution has been recognized since Darwin&#39;s time, and survival-based selection remains a fundamental concept in modern evolutionary theory. Similarly, the role of rewards and punishment in shaping behavior has been a central focus of reinforcement learning research for decades.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.wq2vi2nkjl8o"><span class="c1">The emphasis on survival as a fundamental goal of both reinforcement learning and evolution highlights the deep connection between these two processes and suggests that viewing evolution through a reinforcement learning lens can provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying biological adaptation and change.</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.um080ox5kpjg"><span class="c14 c8">2.2 The role of feedback in both systems</span></h2><p class="c0 c15 subtitle" id="h.rjvp0lesvjl7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.9xcxxsund0us"><span class="c1">One of the critical features of reinforcement learning and natural selection is the use of feedback to guide decision-making and adaptation. In reinforcement learning, agents receive feedback in the form of rewards or punishments that indicate the quality of their actions, allowing them to adjust their behavior to maximize future rewards. In contrast, in evolution, feedback occurs through the differential survival and reproduction of individuals with particular traits, which influences the distribution of traits in future generations.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.vj3fplbg3ts5"><span class="c1">Feedback plays a critical role in shaping the trajectories of both reinforcement learning and natural selection. Without feedback, neither process could efficiently optimize behavior or adapt to changing environments. The importance of feedback in these systems highlights the value of continuous monitoring and adjustment in the face of changing circumstances.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.s7jc5notxe4i"><span class="c1">In reinforcement learning, the importance of feedback has been extensively studied, and algorithms have been developed to optimize the feedback process, such as Q-learning and policy gradient methods (Sutton &amp; Barto, 2018). Similarly, feedback is a central concept in evolutionary biology, and the idea of natural selection as a feedback process was central to the development of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory (Williams, 1966).</span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.bfw1xx1buruw"><span class="c14 c8">2.3 Examples of how evolutionary processes can be explained by reinforcement learning principles</span></h2><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.no44nk4ik1ws"><span class="c1">The idea of evolution as a form of reinforcement learning can help explain a wide range of biological phenomena, from the origin of novel traits to the development of complex social behaviors. One example of how reinforcement learning principles can apply to evolution is the evolution of coloration in animals. In many cases, coloration serves as a signal to potential mates or predators, with certain colors conveying important information about an individual&#39;s quality or status. Natural selection can favor individuals with particular coloration patterns, leading to the spread of those patterns in a population over time (Endler, 1988). This process can be understood as a form of reinforcement learning, with individuals receiving feedback in the form of increased mating success or reduced predation risk, which influences the distribution of traits in future generations.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.pyt3wgp3sr18"><span class="c1">Another example of how reinforcement learning principles can apply to evolution is the evolution of social behaviors, such as cooperation and altruism. These behaviors can be challenging to explain from an evolutionary perspective, as they involve individuals sacrificing their own fitness for the benefit of others. However, game theory and reinforcement learning models have been used to show how such behaviors can evolve under certain conditions, such as when individuals interact repeatedly and have the opportunity to learn from the outcomes of their interactions (Nowak &amp; Sigmund, 1998).</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.yhpvpippzx8g"><span class="c1">These examples illustrate how the idea of evolution as a form of reinforcement learning can provide new insights into how biological systems adapt and change over time.

Over time, this can lead to the emergence of new species and the diversification of life on earth (Darwin, 1859). This process can be seen as a form of reinforcement learning, with individuals that possess advantageous traits receiving feedback in the form of increased reproductive success, which influences the distribution of traits in future generations.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.c2etczzbcuky"><span class="c1">Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution has been refined and expanded upon over the years, with insights from genetics, ecology, and other fields contributing to our understanding of how evolution works.

At each time step, the agent observes the state of the environment and takes an action, which leads to a new state and a reward signal that reflects the quality of the action. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.</span></p><p class="c2 c21 c15 subtitle" id="h.jvyz7frz18g6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c21 subtitle" id="h.7gqjwivbeb7a"><span class="c1">The similarities between reinforcement learning and evolution are striking. In both cases, there is an agent (an organism or a learning algorithm) that interacts with an environment and receives feedback in the form of a reward signal (fitness or a numerical reward). The agent learns to modify its behavior (its phenotype or its policy) in response to this feedback, with the goal of maximizing its long-term success (survival or cumulative reward) (Whiteson and Stone, 2006).</span></p><p class="c2 c21 c15 subtitle" id="h.ux9flnpawpi"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c21 subtitle" id="h.45k92v5q01zw"><span class="c1">There are also important differences between the two processes. In reinforcement learning, the agent has explicit access to the reward signal and can use it to update its policy directly. In evolution, the connection between phenotype and fitness is often more complex, and the feedback is indirect and noisy. Additionally, while reinforcement learning is often concerned with a single agent learning to optimize its behavior, evolution involves entire populations of organisms interacting and evolving over time (Whiteson and Stone, 2006).</span></p><p class="c2 c21 c15 subtitle" id="h.5ndmb1mi59cd"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c21 subtitle" id="h.vml07ss5q1t0"><span>Despite these differences, the fundamental principles of reinforcement learning and evolution are remarkably similar.

The binary signal consists of a reward or punishment signal that is given to the learning agent based on its behavior. This binary signal is simple yet powerful, as it allows the agent to quickly learn which actions lead to positive outcomes (rewards) and which lead to negative outcomes (punishments). Similarly, the process of natural selection in evolution can also be seen as a binary system of learning. In this case, the binary feedback signal is represented by the survival or extinction of organisms based on their ability to adapt to their environment. Organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to future generations.</span></p><p class="c0 c15 subtitle" id="h.e9kv8g6zxvfu"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.vza9vntdnpgf"><span class="c14 c8">4.2: How the binary system of 1: live, 0: die applies to both reinforcement learning and evolution</span></h2><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.5g60wzbriek9"><span class="c1">The binary system of 1: live, 0: die applies to both reinforcement learning and evolution.

Similarly, the emphasis on survival and feedback in a binary system of learning could be applied to understanding the dynamics of political systems or the behavior of large social groups.

In the context of evolution, feedback can come from a variety of sources, including natural selection, environmental pressures, and social interactions.

Antibiotic resistance arises through a process of natural selection, where bacteria that have a genetic mutation that confers resistance to an antibiotic are more likely to survive and reproduce in the presence of that antibiotic. As a result, the frequency of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a population increases over time, while the frequency of susceptible bacteria decreases.

Reinforcement learning algorithms have already been used to model the evolution of social behavior in a variety of species, including birds, primates, and insects (Kameda et al., 2002; Bergstrom and Lachmann, 2003; Laland and Reader, 2003).

In both cases, there is a process of selection that rewards certain behaviors and penalizes others. In natural selection, individuals that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to their offspring. Similarly, in reinforcement learning, agents that make better decisions are more likely to receive rewards and continue to make similar decisions in the future.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.596p6hu23in7"><span class="c1">There are also important differences between reinforcement learning and natural selection. In reinforcement learning, the agent is actively trying to learn a policy that maximizes its expected cumulative reward. In contrast, natural selection is a passive process that does not involve any intentional learning. Additionally, reinforcement learning typically involves a single agent that is trying to optimize its own reward, whereas natural selection involves populations of individuals that are competing with each other for limited resources.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.xwul2wjjo6m2"><span class="c1">Despite these differences, there are many ways in which reinforcement learning can inform our understanding of natural selection. For example, researchers have used reinforcement learning algorithms to study the evolution of cooperative behavior in animals (Hauser et al., 2014). By modeling individuals as agents that are trying to maximize their expected cumulative reward, researchers were able to show that cooperative behavior can evolve through a process of indirect reciprocity, even in the absence of direct benefits.</span></p><p class="c0 c15 subtitle" id="h.s5byvbq0blne"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c15 subtitle" id="h.9lylmtwcju0g"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c15 subtitle" id="h.ekjk6sfvmzwk"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.onc1ywtt6mnk"><span class="c1">Another example is the study of evolution in changing environments.

For example, we can use reinforcement learning models to study how organisms might respond to changes in habitat quality or climate, and develop targeted conservation interventions that can help to preserve biodiversity in the face of these threats.</span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.gq40hwp1ys2i"><span class="c16 c5 c8"></span></h1><h1 class="c13" id="h.c92jl1u116e4"><span class="c16 c5 c8"></span></h1><h1 class="c13" id="h.op2warwmxgun"><span class="c16 c5 c8"></span></h1><h1 class="c13" id="h.uaiw5dktzntl"><span class="c16 c5 c8"></span></h1><h1 class="c13" id="h.u8a5d07fbwqc"><span class="c16 c5 c8"></span></h1><h1 class="c31" id="h.m3rhwbwb1wte"><span class="c16 c5 c8">9.From Evolution to Simulation: Exploring the Implications of a Reinforcement Learning Framework for Understanding the Nature of Reality</span></h1><h2 class="c12" id="h.spudsoquekjp"><span class="c14 c8">9.1 Simulation Theory in Physics and its Relation to Reinforcement Learning in Evolutionary Processes</span></h2><p class="c0 c15 subtitle" id="h.2du791i9z473"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.62gvbck05ik8"><span class="c1">Simulation theory in physics proposes that our reality could be a computer-generated simulation. This idea has gained traction in recent years, and while it remains a matter of philosophical debate, some physicists have presented scientific arguments in support of the simulation hypothesis (Bostrom, 2003; Lloyd, 2002).</span></p><p class="c0 c15 subtitle" id="h.ucothsjpo91h"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.yoyowvzckex7"><span class="c1">In the context of reinforcement learning and evolutionary processes, simulation theory raises interesting questions about the nature of the environment in which living organisms evolve. If the universe is a simulation, then the &quot;environment&quot; in which organisms evolve may not be real in the conventional sense but rather a simulated reality created by some higher-level entity.</span></p><p class="c0 c15 subtitle" id="h.tbp6927liazd"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.8ads6nvivxf0"><span class="c1">From a mathematical standpoint, the concept of a simulated reality is not fundamentally different from a reinforcement learning environment that is programmed by humans. In both cases, the environment provides feedback to an agent based on its actions, and the agent learns from this feedback to maximize its rewards. Thus, simulation theory in physics can be seen as an extension of the idea of a reinforcement learning environment, where the environment itself may not be real.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c12 c17" id="h.36fh1ughjr2h"><span class="c14 c8"></span></h2><h2 class="c12" id="h.kxqmyvv3wyq8"><span class="c14 c8">9.2 If Evolution is Reinforcement Learning, Could Nature be a Simulation?</span></h2><p class="c0 c15 subtitle" id="h.mpasei5g6qqs"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.te5zdyvrxwf4"><span class="c1">The notion that nature could be a simulation raises the question of whether evolution itself could be viewed as a form of reinforcement learning in a simulated environment. If so, then the same principles that apply to artificial reinforcement learning systems could be applied to our understanding of evolution. This would suggest that the &quot;fitness landscape&quot; in which organisms evolve is not an objective reality but rather a construct of the simulated environment.</span></p><p class="c0 c15 subtitle" id="h.cgzjoet5sqos"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.i7olyx4sw8ow"><span class="c1">This idea has interesting implications for our understanding of evolution and the nature of reality itself. If evolution is viewed as a form of reinforcement learning in a simulated environment, then the concept of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; takes on a new meaning. Instead of being a competition between objectively defined fitness levels, evolution becomes a process of agents learning to adapt to the rules of the simulated environment in order to maximize their rewards.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.lhmfc8nxxny5"><span class="c1">While the idea that nature could be a simulation remains a matter of philosophical debate, the connection between reinforcement learning and evolution suggests that the principles of reinforcement learning could be a useful tool for understanding the evolution of life on Earth, regardless of the nature of the underlying reality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.6vcpdja9e5du"><span class="c1">In conclusion, the application of reinforcement learning principles to the study of natural selection and evolution has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of how biological systems adapt to changing environments. By providing a more precise and quantitative framework for studying evolutionary change, reinforcement learning can help us to make new predictions about the kinds of adaptations that will evolve, and how they will change over time. This can ultimately lead to new insights into the mechanisms of evolution and the ways in which we can manage and conserve the biodiversity of our planet.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c19" id="h.akvnf79p796v"><span class="c16 c5 c8">Conclusion</span></h1><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.8buzlkvbg6pp"><span class="c1">In conclusion, this research has explored the connections between evolutionary biology and reinforcement learning, highlighting the potential for these two fields to inform and enhance each other. We have seen how the binary system of 1: live, 0: die applies to both reinforcement learning and evolution, and how the concept of survival of the fittest can be reframed as survival of the learner.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.dl21e5ozy41g"><span class="c1">Moreover, we have discussed the importance of feedback in both reinforcement learning and evolution, and how reinforcement learning principles can enhance our understanding of feedback in evolutionary systems. We have also explored the role of natural selection in evolutionary theory and its connection to reinforcement learning.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.ssni97xmbtxk"><span class="c1">The implications of these connections are far-reaching, as they challenge traditional notions of how we understand evolution and open up new avenues for research and exploration. We have seen how these ideas could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the possibility that nature itself could be a simulation.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.x88w6bhah28w"><span class="c1">The potential limitations of a binary system of learning have also been considered, as well as the ethical implications of applying reinforcement learning principles to evolutionary systems. Nevertheless, the power and simplicity of these frameworks have made them attractive tools for understanding complex biological phenomena.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.vdc5kw4t3la6"><span class="c1">Overall, this research has demonstrated the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in scientific inquiry. By bringing together insights and methods from disparate fields, we can gain a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the natural world. The connections between evolutionary biology and reinforcement learning are just one example of this kind of collaboration, and we can expect many more exciting developments in the future.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.n1vmji8lrj2n"><span class="c16 c5 c8"></span></h1><h1 class="c13" id="h.4mclmz96qqmg"><span class="c16 c5 c8"></span></h1><h1 class="c13" id="h.9z8kk65yxitr"><span class="c16 c5 c8"></span></h1><h1 class="c31" id="h.2jxsxqh"><span class="c16 c5 c8">Discussion</span></h1><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.oyd753jt98s5"><span class="c1">The exploration of the connections and implications between reinforcement learning and evolution presented in this paper sheds light on the potential for a new perspective on evolution.

This perspective highlights the importance of feedback in driving adaptation and emphasizes the role of learning in the evolutionary process.</span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.j3f6h18v56kw"><span class="c1">Furthermore, the application of reinforcement learning principles to evolution has potential implications for various fields, including artificial intelligence, robotics, and even physics.

One promising direction is the exploration of how reinforcement learning principles can be applied to understanding other biological processes, such as development, immune system function, and even disease progression. Another direction is the potential for developing new computational models that integrate both reinforcement learning and evolutionary principles to better simulate and predict the behavior of complex biological systems. Additionally, more research is needed to fully explore the implications of a learning-focused perspective on our understanding of evolution, including its potential applications in fields such as conservation biology and evolutionary medicine.</span></p><h1 class="c31" id="h.r1hruodf8f8w"><span class="c16 c5 c8">Limitations of the Study:</span></h1><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.esgzy29ox0ke"><span class="c1">Despite the significant insights gained from this research, there are several limitations that should be acknowledged. One major limitation is the current lack of empirical evidence to support the idea that evolution can be viewed as a reinforcement learning process. While theoretical models and simulations have provided strong support for this idea, further empirical validation is needed to fully establish its validity. Additionally, the complexity of biological systems presents a significant challenge to accurately modeling and simulating their behavior, and future research will need to address this challenge through the development of new computational methods and tools.</span></p><p class="c4 c21"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c31" id="h.z337ya"><span class="c16 c5 c8">References</span></h1><ol class="c27 lst-kix_1gk03n6hzp1o-0 start" start="1"><li class="c20 c18 subtitle li-bullet-0" id="h.dsk8km5blgaz"><span class="c10 c5">Watson, R.
